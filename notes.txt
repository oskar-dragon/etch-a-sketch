1. Problem

Create a sketch board where a user can draw on it using cursor. When user hovers over a cell, it should change the colour.

A user should have an option to change the grid size
A user should have an option to clear the grid
A user should have an option to change the colour in which he/she is drawing on that board. 

Pseudo Code:

gridCells = 20
cellColour = #fff;

FUNCTION createGrid
	IF gridCells > 100
		throw ERROR
	ELSE
	grab element in which you want to put your cells into
	cellWidthandHeight = 1000 / cells
	
	LOOP gridCell times to create gridCells amount of cells
		create new DIV element
		add "grid-cell" class to DIV element
		add width to that grid element
		add height to that grid element
		add backgroundColor to that grid element
		append DIV element to parent element
		
		
Invoke createGrid function

add HOVER OVER EVENT LISTENER to all gridCells and when event occurs, it should use callback function

CALLBACK FUNTION
	grab element
	change elements colour (use cellColour)

add CLICK EVENT LISTENER to "Clear" button and when event occurs, use the following callback function

CALLBACK FUNTION
	grab all cells
	iterate through all of them
	change styling to default (white background)


add CLICK EVENT LISTENER to "Change size" button and when event occurs, use the following callback function

CALLBACK FUNCTION
	take value from input
	add this value to gridCells variable
	grab all cells
	iterate through all of them and change styling to default (white background)
	Invoke createGrid function


add INPUT EVENT LISTENER to "Colour picker" and when event occurs, use the following callback function

CALLBACK FUNTION
	colour = e.target.value
	push this new colour to cellColour
